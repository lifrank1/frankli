                <h2>Hi, I'm Frank!</h2>
                <p>I'm a junior studying computer science & engineering at the Ohio State University</p>

                <p>This past summer of 2023, I interned at Fiserv, where I worked on the Cloud Security and Architecture Team to migrate services to a serverless architecture and automate data validation and cloud environment security</p>

                <p>On campus, I research with Laine Rumreich. I'm also involved in the Big Data Analytics Association where I work on 
                    new member initiatives and helped redesign and rebuild an outdated website.
                </p>

                <p>Outside of academics, I enjoy playing all kinds of sports, watching movies, and lifting! </p>

                <p>Please reach out I love to talk! I can be reached through <a href="mailto:frank.li.865985@gmail.com" className="red-no-underline">email</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lifrank1/" className="red-no-underline">LinkedIn</a></p>
