        This past summer I interned at Fiserv, where I worked on the
        Cloud Security and Architecture Team to migrate services to a serverless
        architecture and automate data validation and cloud environment security
      </p>

        On campus, I research with Laine Rumreich. I'm also involved in the Big
        Data Analytics Association where I work on new member initiatives and
        helped redesign and rebuild an outdated website.

        Outside of academics, I enjoy playing all kinds of sports, watching
        movies, and lifting. I love to try new things; currently, I'm learning
        how to cook and self teaching guitar.{" "}
